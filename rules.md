# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment 
 1. I will code or work through coding problems for at least an hour a day.
 2. I will workout everyday.
 3. No Social Media (for atleast 30 days).
 4. I will journal my experiences throughout the 100 days.
 


#### Start Date
August 1st, 2022

## Additional Rules
1. No Social Media for 30 days.
2. Youtube is a SECONDARY resource.
3. Push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. Update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. Work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read [FAQ](FAQ.md))
6. Must complete 40 Push ups and 50 Squats OR 8 drop sets of Leg Lifts and 50 squats.
7. Keep a Daily Journal of how I feel and what progress I recognize or lack thereof.



## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/)
3. If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/)
4. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
5. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.


## Workout Guide ##
With wanting to learn how to program and understand programming languages, we all spend a good amount of time inside, in front of a screen, sitting, etc. I choose to include a soft workout so I can not only see the transformation of my ability to code AND my physical transfomation, but more importantly, to build good habits of daily exersice from day one of learning to code. Yes computer programming, virtual worlds, digital currencoes are the future. However none of that means it is okay to build habits that dont impove your quality of life. Like a hunch back and weak hamstrings from sitting and coding all day. All the workouts listed below are bodyweight workouts, meaning they require nothing but effort. No gym Membership, No Trainer needed, No weights.
