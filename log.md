# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 1st, 2022
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Began figuring out what values are needed to build a database to track Who has recieved what services, and when they recieved them. 

**Thoughts:** After reading through the python database tutorial and trying to understand each syntax or function and it becomes slightly understandable once you understand the basics. Although figuring out git is easily the hardest part about this.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
