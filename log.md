# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, August 1st 2022

**Today's Progress**: Began figuring out what values are needed to build a database to track Who has recieved what services, and when they recieved them. 

**Thoughts:** After reading through the python database tutorial and trying to understand each syntax or function and it becomes slightly understandable once you understand the basics. Although figuring out git is easily the hardest part about this.

### Day 1: Tuesday, August 2nd 2022
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Today i spent more time understanding than actually coding. While trying to build a database i found so many different connectors and couldnt understand how to use them so i spent a majority of the time trying to learn how to use mysql

**Thoughts**: Struggled but honestly as i become more submerged in the industry/ activity i know that i can get it. Knowing that this is a industry built on "google it bro" is somewhat settling knowing that nobody really knows so you minds well try to be the first to figure it out. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Null](Unable to figure out how to link the 6 lines of failed code i did today. But it was a direct copy of a tutorial i was following and couoldnt seem to make it work on my end. 

### Day 2: August 3rd, Wednesday 2022


**Today's Progress**:
Managed to get one step farther by downloading the proper packets and drivers for mysql. Still stuck at finding a debugger for SQL in order to run programs for database.

**Thoughts** 
I am struggling to figure out how to debug my SQL, i have downloaded the shell and additional extensions and i have looked around the internet and youtube to no avail. I was able to get one step farther than yesterday but i wasnt able to complete the debugging process that i started yesterday. I spent more time understanding code and coding than yesterday. Although im still having trouble figuring out Git it is proving usefully efficient as i leanr more and more about it. I feel pretty good about my programming journey so far and look forward to trying to work though this debugging problem. I intend on asking someone at the library if they have any resources that could better help solve my problem.

### Day 3: Thursday August 4th, 2022
**Today's Progress**:
I decided to take a break from looking for a way to debug my sql programs and decided to try and build a bot of some sort that scrapes twitter for information. However i kept running into problems importing the neccesary libraries needed to run that bot. so i moved on to a different tutorial that felt more fundamental that had to do with grabbing api's and scraping info that way. Again running into issues figuring out how to properly import libraries and completing a test run on the program. I managed ti only code a couple lines before i ran into issues and i dont think its worth linking. so whatever i do tomorrow i will make sure i get some coding done and linked.

**Thoughts** 
This is not something you do for one hour a day, stop and pick back up where you left off the next day.. This is more of a never ending questioning of ones own sanity and ones one necessity. "do i really need to learn this? is this really what i wanna do?" i keep finding myself getting almost overwhelmed at the idea of not being able to find the answer to a problem of mine like "how to debug sql?" or "why doesny my program want to import anything properly/ entierly?" Sure i dont get as upset as i used to but its still diheartening giving the prediciment im in and in the early stages..... in that last sentance i was throwing myself a pitty party and gifting myself unrealistic excuses for why i havent figuredout what im tryibg ti figure out. when i took this challange up i decided i was going to learn how to program in python. and thats just what ill do reguardless of how "hard" it is. I do think its hard, i think im falling into the belief of others. im unerstanding it more and more day by day i just dont put in 140% effort like i know i should. Today i woke up and laid in bed for 4 hours, ive been doing stuff all day today that has been hindering my prograssion and i cannot let my circumstances be the reason i remain in the same prediciments.

### Day 4: Thursday August 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Startered a course on python from Freecodecamp.org, following along on their youtube live streat has helped me tremdiously. By giving me a baseline to start at and showing me very key things like keywords and explaining with understanding in mind opposed to "if it does make sense google it." and moving on like everyone else. I only got about an hour into the course but i was able to understand way more than when i woke up and i have an understanding on what i should be trying to learn to make this experience much more fluid. 

**Thoughts**
I watched a video about some indian guy learning and aapplying python in 30 days and he laid out a pretty good framework on what to learn and how to learn it in order to have a chance at learning prython in 30 days. After taking his advice and finding a course i was able to get a couple lines of code down today like i promised. but more importantly i felt like i was absorbing the info her was sharing and it helpped me stay excited about learning computer science as a whole on just programming. Today i will make a list of pythons keywords and define what they do and practice memorizing them to help prepare me for tommorrow.

### Day 5: Thursday August 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
Picked up where i left off yesterday finished the video and was able to follow along and workout the bugs i was running into on my own. sure i needed google and stack overfllow but i think thats part of learning how to be resourceful in this. i did end up writing out all the key words and what they do, but i think that i should take it a step farther and organize them into categories of what they do and what colors they are expected to be to better help the proccess of memorizing them. Once you know what everything does it will be easier to call functions and build full operations. Looking forward to starting the next video. Alothough i have notied that im going to have to expand on this hour a day if i really want to get good so i will have to find a quiet place to actually code throughout the day besides the library, which only gives me 3 hours a day in a study room. will i use 2 hours of it a day to code like i did today? (googling, and searching stack overflow to debug my code instead of trying to copy line for line character for character doubled my time today.)

**Thoughts**
Git is still the hardest part about this whole experience. its almost useslessly complicted for someone like me who just builds on vs code and soit can be saved/logged on github locally but perferably online. I want to be able to seamlessly create a repo, pull, and commit to them and also be able to collaborate with others fluidly instead of spending an hour trying to retrace my steps looking for where i didnt commit or what not. I can feel the progress, the question "is my code efficient" makes perfect sense now where as yesterday i would have guessed and still been confused. Today i know what it means " have i laid out the most simple yet computable code or is there some unneeded steps?"

### Day 9: Monday, August 8th 2022 ###

**Today's Progress**:
started the second section of the course and was able to only get through about 25 minutes of it due to the many times i paused to debug my own code or to try and go ahead and solve upcoming problems. 

**Thoughts**
Today was the worst of them all, i only made it about 25 minutes through the course today instead of normally getting through at least 45 minutes worth. Im going to attribute todays prgress to three factors. My lack of quality sleep, my decision to take sunday off, and the constant thought of " why am i leanring to code when i want a Saas? i could/should be focusing on building out the intricate details of the project and solidifying funding to have a professional just build it and i get it to the people who will need it. But i also dont want to give up this challenge. i enenjoy it but the fine details of my life are starting to take a tol on me. i have been able to maintaine the workout regimen but the idea of sitting and going through a course with no headphones and limited internet is very dauntin. Im interested and really believe computer programming is the future, but im also nervous that by spending so much time learning how to build a software from scrate, i could be using that same time to acutally build a no code or low code to produce a minimum viable product then begin reaching out to potential clients. Tomorrow will be better!

### Day 10: Tuesday, August 9th 2022 ###

**Today's Progress**
was able to learn list and the random function. had a great time learning how to organize numbers in a list and how to increment/decrament numbers in general. made more than double yesterdays progress in about an 2 hours.

**Thoughts**

Today was full of roses and excitment. as the 10% marker i have really had a great day in reguards to coding and i was on the fence about even doing it today. I keep seeing these "No Code" projects and stuff but i honestly am very intruged with learning how to communicate with a computer. im not just learning programming to make a software, retire and push a Bugatti till my days end. Sure that is part of the future but i really do see the benefits of knowing how to manipulate computers to your will. Today was probably the longest i spent sitting and coding/debugging and i honestly had so much fun trying to get my print messages to show up.

### Day 11: Wednesday, August 10th 2022 ###

**Today's Progress**
finished second video of the course and began learning how to build times tables and organize lists of numbers into another list.


**Thoughts**

Today i had a pretty good time, i sped the course up to 1.5x speed cause he was talking to slow and i was trying to get through the content. Ive noticed im ready to get it going i dont like the off topic stuff. and i dont like going too slow so by speeding up the content i can listen closer and when i do pause i dont lose as much time as i would if it was playing at a normal playback speed. Today i made it aboout an hour and a half and had a pretty good time.
