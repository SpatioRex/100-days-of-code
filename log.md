# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, August 1st 2022
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Began figuring out what values are needed to build a database to track Who has recieved what services, and when they recieved them. 

**Thoughts:** After reading through the python database tutorial and trying to understand each syntax or function and it becomes slightly understandable once you understand the basics. Although figuring out git is easily the hardest part about this.

### Day 1: Tuesday, August 2nd 2022
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Today i spent more time understanding than actually coding. While trying to build a database i found so many different connectors and couldnt understand how to use them so i spent a majority of the time trying to learn how to use mysql

**Thoughts**: Struggled but honestly as i become more submerged in the industry/ activity i know that i can get it. Knowing that this is a industry built on "google it bro" is somewhat settling knowing that nobody really knows so you minds well try to be the first to figure it out. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Null](Unable to figure out how to link the 6 lines of failed code i did today. But it was a direct copy of a tutorial i was following and couoldnt seem to make it work on my end. 

### Day 2: June 27, Monday
