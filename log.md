# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, August 1st 2022
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Began figuring out what values are needed to build a database to track Who has recieved what services, and when they recieved them. 

**Thoughts:** After reading through the python database tutorial and trying to understand each syntax or function and it becomes slightly understandable once you understand the basics. Although figuring out git is easily the hardest part about this.

### Day 1: Tuesday, August 2nd 2022
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Today i spent more time understanding than actually coding. While trying to build a database i found so many different connectors and couldnt understand how to use them so i spent a majority of the time trying to learn how to use mysql

**Thoughts**: Struggled but honestly as i become more submerged in the industry/ activity i know that i can get it. Knowing that this is a industry built on "google it bro" is somewhat settling knowing that nobody really knows so you minds well try to be the first to figure it out. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Null](Unable to figure out how to link the 6 lines of failed code i did today. But it was a direct copy of a tutorial i was following and couoldnt seem to make it work on my end. 

### Day 2: August 3rd, Wednesday 2022


**Today's Progress**:
Managed to get one step farther by downloading the proper packets and drivers for mysql. Still stuck at finding a debugger for SQL in order to run programs for database.

**Thoughts** 
I am struggling to figure out how to debug my SQL, i have downloaded the shell and additional extensions and i have looked around the internet and youtube to no avail. I was able to get one step farther than yesterday but i wasnt able to complete the debugging process that i started yesterday. I spent more time understanding code and coding than yesterday. Although im still having trouble figuring out Git it is proving usefully efficient as i leanr more and more about it. I feel pretty good about my programming journey so far and look forward to trying to work though this debugging problem. I intend on asking someone at the library if they have any resources that could better help solve my problem.
